## Overview
The point of this repository is to outline and store common data structures and sorting algorithms.
Of course these are readily available for anyone to use, though these are very basic implementations
written in python. These are solely for educational purposes. 

## Datastructures


## Sorting
These are just a few of many sorting algorithms - below you will find the algo and the space
and time complexity as well as the average case and worst case scenario run complexities

| Algo             | Time Complexity | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| ---: | :---:           | :---:           | :---:            |
|                  | **Average**     | **Worst**       | **Worst**        |
| [Radix](#radix)  | `O(nk)`       |`O(nk)`          |`O(n+k)`|
| [Bucket](#bucket) | `O(nk)`       |`O(nk)`          |`O(n+k)`|
| [Quick](#quick)  | `O(n log(n))` |`O(n^2)`         |`O(log(n))`|
| [Bubble](#bubble) | `O(n^2)`      |`O(n^2)`         |`O(1)`|
| [Merge](#merge)  | `O(n log(n))` |`O(n log(n))`    |`O(n)`|
